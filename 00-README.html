<h1>The Functional Parsing Library</h1>

<p>
In this library I, Peter Ljunglöf, have collected Haskell files for the
parsers and parsing algorithms described in my Licenciate Thesis.
Observe that you will need the following extensions of Haskell 98:
<ul>
  <li>Multi-parameter type classes with functional dependencies
  <li>Existential quantification in data types
</ul>
The files here are tested in both Hugs and GHC (with the appropriate
flags for turning on Haskell extensions).
</p>

<p>
Any questions or comments on the code or the thesis are of course
much appreciated.
</p>

<h3><a href="parsers/">Combinator Parsers</a>&nbsp; (ch. 3 and 4)</h3>

<p>
The parsers described in these chapters can be found
in the <strong><code>parsers</code></strong> directory.
Apart from the files in that directory you will need the
<strong><code>OrdMap</code></strong> module from this directory.
</p>

<h3><a href="algorithms/">Parsing Algorithms</a>&nbsp; (ch. 5, 6 and 7)</h3>

<p>
The parsers described in these chapters can be found in the
<strong><code>algorithms</code></strong> directory.
Apart from the files in that directory you will need the
<strong><code>OrdSet</code></strong> and
<strong><code>OrdMap</code></strong> modules from this directory.
</p>

<h3><a href="collecting-parser/">The Grammar Collecting Parser</a>&nbsp; (ch. 8)</h3>

<p>
The grammar collecting parser makes use of files from
various places, apart from the module of your choice
from the <strong><code>collecting-parser</code></strong> directory.
First you need the
<strong><code>OrdSet</code></strong> and
<strong><code>OrdMap</code></strong> modules from this directory;
second you need the
<strong><code>Parser</code></strong> module from
the <strong><code>parsers</code></strong> directory;
and third you need the appropriate modules from the
<strong><code>algorithms</code></strong> directory,
to be able to run the chosen parsing algorithm.
