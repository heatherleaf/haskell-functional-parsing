This is a library of Haskell files associated with my licenciate thesis from 2002. The library consists of the following:

  * implementations of different parser combinators (chapters 3–4 and 8)
  * implementations of different context-free parsing algorithms (chapters 5–7)

**Note 1**: This is a programming library! Good knowledge of Haskell is required.

**Note 2**: This code was written in 2002, and has not been modified since. It should work, but I do not guarantee anything at this time.

**Note 3**: You will need the following extensions of Haskell 98, which both Hugs and GHC has:
Multi-parameter type classes with functional dependencies, and
Existential quantification in data types.
